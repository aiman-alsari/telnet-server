Java based Telnet Server
Written by Aiman Alsari 10/9/2013

=============
Quick Setup
=============

Build using maven:
	mvn package

Run the jar file using:
	java -cp target/telnet-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar nz.co.ahc.TelnetServer

This will start the telnet server with default options. You can connect to this using a telnet client on port 8080


==============
Configuration
==============

You can configure the telnet server using a configuration file called server.cfg.
The cfg file is a standard key-value pair properties file and is read from the working directory.

The available properties are:
 
 port=[The port to run the server on, default 8080]
 host=[The host name or IP address that we are binding this socket to, defaults to 0.0.0.0, falls back to the loopback interface]
 max_clients=[The maximum number of clients and threads that are run before the server starts blocking, default 10]
 home_dir=[The directory that the file manager starts off at, default is the directory that the Server is located in]
